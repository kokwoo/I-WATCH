# I-WATCH

Hardware used: LPC1769 & EA Baseboard

In this assignment we are supposed to design an electronic tagging device called I-WATCH.

The acronym for this initiative is I-WATCH which stands for Initiative for Wildlife Analysis, Telemetry and Conservation of Habitat. This tagging device will be used by scientist to monitor the routine of wildlife animals without interfering with their daily activities.

Our objective for this assignment is to be able to apply system design approaches with the use of flowcharts, design embedded applications, understand the interfaces between microcontrollers and peripherals, and gain the ability to develop C embedded programming controller based applications.

The Initiative for Wildlife Analysis, Telemetry and Conservation of Habitat (I-WATCH) tag have two exclusive modes of operations: Configuration and Testing (CAT) mode and ACTIVE mode, which would be transmitting to the Satellite Communication and Archiving Network (SCAN) if the necessary conditions are fulfilled.
